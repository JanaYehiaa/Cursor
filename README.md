### Overview 
This code imitates how the cursor works. To run, just download the source code and run it in any environment that supports C++. 

### Description & Purpose
The purpose of this simple project is to demonstrate understanding of the usage and implementation of the stack abstract data type (ADT) in solving real-world problems. Specifically, The array implementation of Stack ADT was used. 

This code includes the functions: 
* Left, which moves the cursor one position to the left within the word, if possible.
* Right, which moves the cursor one position to the right within the word, if possible. 
* Remove, which deletes a letter to the left of the cursor, if there is any. 
* Insert, which adds a letter to the left of the cursor.
* GetText, which displays the word in the terminal. 

All functions utilize Stacks to achieve results. 

### Future Work
Extend functionality to support undo and redo actions. 
Add cursor movements and editing options.

### Demonstration
Here is a screenshot from output in terminal:
